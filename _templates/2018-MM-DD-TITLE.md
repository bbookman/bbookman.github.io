# Headline
Your headline and opening image are the only things people have to judge your story on. Before they can even read your story’s first paragraph, they must answer a question. It’s the same question that we all ask ourselves every day: is this going to be worth my time?

* 8 to 14-word headline
* 80 characters or fewer
* The more emotional (positive or negative) a headline is, the more likely people will click it
