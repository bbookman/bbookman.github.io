Ran into this today in Xcode..
`XXYY\[14233:15575292\] Falling back to storing access token in NSUserDefaults because of simulator bug 2018-03-22 11:30:30.241046-0700 XXYY\[14233:15575525\] \*\*Month 13 is out of bounds\*\*`

There is no real problem here, but it is funny.  I know this is not coming from my code.  Where is Month 13 coming from?
