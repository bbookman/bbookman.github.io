One big lesson I learned is that you should build a community **before even releasing**your app. If that is not possible, here are some tips.

Do you have a social media presence? That’s really going to be your major outlet for free marketing. I just finished writing a [blog post](https://dazz.link/DQOx8DJ) about using Crowdfire to help grow and tend to social channels. I did pay to upgrade, h[owever Crowdfire offers solid features for free.](https://dazz.link/DQOx8DJ)

Even though your app is already on the store, you could consider running a beta - what you could call a _“marketing beta_” and list your app on the following sites:

* [https://www.betabound.com/](https://www.betabound.com/ "https://www.betabound.com/")
* [http://betatesters.io/](https://www.betabound.com/ "https://www.betabound.com/")
* [https://arkenea.com/blog/mobile-...](https://www.betabound.com/ "https://www.betabound.com/")
* [https://www.apptamin.com/blog/fi...](https://www.betabound.com/ "https://www.betabound.com/")

There are a ton more, but those are what I happen to have bookmarked.
