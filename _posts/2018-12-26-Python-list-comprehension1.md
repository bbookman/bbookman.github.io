# How can a python newbie can stand out in a sea of competition?  Show your list comprehension

As a Software Quality Assurance Engineer, I use python as one tool in my test automation tool chest.  List comprehension is one of the python techniques that not only adds flair to your code, it also saves cpu cycles and is considered 'Pythonic'.

## What is list comprehension?
The list comprehension syntax is somewhat of a compressed 'for' loop.

### Classic 'for' loop
Given a list of numbers, remove all odd numbers from the list:
```Python
numbers = [3,5,45,97,32,22,10,19,39,43]
result = []
for number in numbers:
  if number % 2 == 0:
    result.append(number)
print(result)
```

### The list comprehension way
```Python
result = [number for number in numbers if number % 2 == 0]
print(result)
```
So glorious, so pretty, so pythonic ;)

## List comprehension syntax
The trickiest part of learning list comprehension for me was really understanding the syntax.  The best method of explaining IMO is from [Tutorial â€“ Python List Comprehension With Examples](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/01/python-tutorial-list-comprehension-examples/)

A traditional for loop:

## Examples
### Given a list of numbers, remove floats (numbers with decimals)
```python
original_list = [2,3.75,.04,59.354,6,7.7777,8,9]
only_ints = [number for number in original_list if type(number) == int]
print(only_ints)
```

## Practice
I needed practice, so I used this list.  Each challenge below links to a solution gist.
