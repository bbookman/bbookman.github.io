# Python virtual environments
I'm good at forgetting syntax.  And when working in Python, and creating virtual environments - I can never seem to remember the key steps.

And it seems that when I look things up, for some reason I have to put 3 different resources together to be successful.

# Python 2
## Check if it is already installed
Check to see if virtualenv is already installed
```
virtualenv --version
```
The result, if installed, will be a version number such as 16.1.0

## Check for pip install
Before installing virtualenv, make sure you have pip (which comes standard with most modern releases of Python).
```
pip --version
```
The result,if installed, will be a version number such as 'pip 18.1'

Don't have pip? [Follow these instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

## If virtualenv is not installed, use pip to install
```
sudo pip install virtualenv
```
## Set up directories
I like to have all my virtual environments under a main directory.  I suggest creating a directory named 'python_virtual_environments'

```
mkdir python_virtual_environments
```
## Which version of python
Many development environments will come standard with at least one version of Python, usually many versions.  

Get a list of Python versions with this command
```
ls /usr/bin | grep python*
```
## Create virtual environment
To create a virtual environment, you need to choose a version.

The syntax is:
```
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python## my_virtual_env_directory
```

So if you wanted to create a virtual environment for a project named 'scooby_duby_app', and needed Python 3, this would be the command set

```
cd my_virtual_env_directory
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 scooby_duby_app
```

This will create a directory ''/my_virtual_env_directory/scooby_duby_app'

Lastly, activate the virtual environment
```
cd scooby_duby_app
source bin/activate
```

# Python 3
Python 3 comes with venv, which works like virtualenv for Python 2.

## Create virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv <name_of_virtual_environment>
```
